Reddit User Persona Builder
This Python project generates a User Persona based on a Reddit user's public posts and comments. It combines Reddit API data with powerful natural language analysis using an LLM (OpenAI's GPT) to infer personality traits, interests, communication style, and more â€” just like a digital behavior analyst.
